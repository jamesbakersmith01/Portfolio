    //   My name is James BakerSmith and I am a Web Developer / Mobile Developer. 

    //   I believe if the world was more minimal and intuitive, we would progress as a species more rapidly than we do now. 
    //   I do my part by creating websites and applications that make the process of using technology much more enjoyable.
      
    //   If you have a vision, I would love to help communicate your story to others. Being a workaholic, 
    //   I dedicate all my passion, energy, sleep until we both are satisfied with the outcome. 
      
    //   I am a Bootcamp graduate as well as self taught, I believe I'm different from others due to my unique and diverse thought process. 
    //   When working on a project I am my biggest critic; though this can be impeding, 
    //   I use it as my drive to give myself the strength to always strive for more improvement, to learn more, and be more creative.
