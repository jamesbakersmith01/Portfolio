              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>My name is James BakerSmith and I am a Web Developer / Mobile App Developer. 

                I believe if the world was more minimal and intuitive, we would progress as a species more rapidly than we do now. 
                I do my part by creating websites and applications that make the process of using technology much more enjoyable.

                If you have a vision, I would love to help communicate your story to others. Being a workaholic, 
                I dedicate all my passion, energy, sleep until we both are satisfied with the outcome. 

                I am a Bootcamp graduate as well as self taught, I believe I'm different from others due to my unique and diverse thought process. 
                When working on a project I am my own critic; though this can be impeding, 
                I use it as my drive to give myself the strength to always strive for more improvement, to learn more, and be more creative.
